# Getting start
You play as a survivor that has to kill zombies in order to control of them and fight the other player. 
This game is decomposed of zombies spawning waves. Each spawning waves is divided into two rounds with are the following :

### Round 1
Both player have to kill as many zombies as possible in order to survive. Indeed, their life decrease every seconds 
and the only way to regain some is by killing zombies.
Once this round is finished, round 2 start.

### Round 2
In this round, all the dead zombies come back to life and attack the players that hasn't kill them. So each zombie belong to a player.
In addition, players don't regain life as they kill those zombies. 
This round is temporary and a timer is set to let players know the end of it. When the timer run out of time, a new wave of zombies spawn. 
This rotation keeps going until one of the players died.
